## Introduction to Data Analysis in Python ##

In this week, you will begin to use Python and Unix to learn about regular expressions and their associated commands so that you can search through text more effectively.  To finish up, you will learn about Unix text processing so that you can better modify and glean information from lines and files of text.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand and be able to utilize regular expressions to better streamline searches through text.
- Utilize grep options.
- Utilize metacharacters and literal characters for grep searches.
- Understand how to use the sub, search, and compile functions within the re library.
- Understand how to structure verbose regular expressions.
- Understand how to effectively specify the position and structure of the string you are searching for by using ```\b, ^, $, \d, \D, ?, *, +, {n,m}, (a|b),``` etc.
- Understand how to sort through lines of text and report differences of files through the use of ```sort and uniq, comm, and diff```.
- Understand how to modify lines of text and files using ```cut, paste, join, and patch```.
- Understand how to use ```tr, sed, and aspell``` to transform and check through lines of text.
